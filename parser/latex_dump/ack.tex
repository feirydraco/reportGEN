The joy and satisfaction that accompany the successful completion of any task would be incomplete without thanking those who made it possible. I consider myself proud to be a part of RNS Institute of Technology, the institution which moulded me in all my endeavours. I express my gratitude to beloved Chairman \textbf{Dr. R N Shetty}, for providing state of art facilities. I express my deep gratitude to \textbf{Dr. H N Shivashankar}, Director, who has always been a great source of inspiration.

\medskip

I would like to express my sincere thanks to \textbf{Dr. M K Venkatesha}, Principal and \textbf{Dr. G.T. Raju}, Vice Principal, Professor and HOD, Department of CSE, for their valuable guidance and encouragement throughout. I extend my sincere thanks and heartfelt gratitude to my Technical seminar reviewer \textbf{Mr. Devraju B.M.}, Asst. Prof., Department of CSE.

\medskip

Finally, I take this opportunity to extend my earnest gratitude and respect to my parents, teaching and non-teaching staff of the department, the library staff and all my friends who have directly or indirectly supported me.

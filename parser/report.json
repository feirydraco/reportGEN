One of the key contributions of technology has been optimization of human effort. In an attempt to utilize and develop a systematic information storage and retrieval system for one such domain, the idea of Leave Web Application originated. The main objective of the system is in helping the company retrieve most of the\r\ninformation about leave applied by employees.\r\n\r\n<BR>\r\n\r\nThe project leave web application includes employee login, manager login. Employee login enables employees to apply for leave. Employee can also view their leave status. Manager login enables the manager to either accept or reject the leave for subordinates. \r\n\r\n<BR>\r\n\r\nThe project implements the client-server based architecture model, in which the clients can request the server for various data that is processed and stored by the server module. The complete process in this application is based on three-tier architecture in which the client-server interaction is the front-end processing and database is the back-end tool.\r\n"}}, "chapters": [{"name": "asd", "number": 1, "content": [{"type": "text", "id": 1, "content": "sad"}, {"type": "image", "id": 2, "content": "xyz.jpg"}, {"type": "text", "id": 3, "content": "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.
